# workspaces-4-foxfire

Features workspaces for Firefox similar to Opera's, accessed via keyboard shortcuts, persistent across restarts.


## Operation

- `alt + 1-9` - change current workspace
- `alt + g` - merge and reset all workspaces


## Recommendation

Change that closing the last tab automatically closes the window
- in the search bar, enter `about:config`
- there, search for `browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab`
- set it to `false`, by double clicking `true`


## Other Notes

Absolutely no data is collected, hence neither shared nor sold.

The plugin is open-source, so feel free to validate its behaviour.
